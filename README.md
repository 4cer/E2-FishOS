# E2-FishOS
FishOS is an operating system for E2, inspired by MacOS (at least in the visual departament)

Everybody is allowed and encouraged to help develop the project. If you decide to contribute, here are a few things to keep in mind:
- Make comments in the code, outlining it's functionality as to not confuse other contributors.
- Try to keep changes moving in a forward motion, as in don't remove working functions without a reason
- Do not commit broken code to the main file
- Do not contribute unrelated file to this project

In-game set up:
0. Spawn E2 and upload the code
1. Wire a button with "toggle" option checked to the "ON" input
2. Spawn an EGP screen
3. Wire "EGP[wirelink]" on the screen to "EGP" on the E2
4. Wire "User[entity]" on the screen to "EGP" on the E2

With that out of the way, you are now ready to use the FishOS!
